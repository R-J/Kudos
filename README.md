# Kudos
Kudos plugin for the Vanilla Forums platform

This plugin has been moved here, as I don't know where the original author, keepitterron, originally hosted it.

You can view the [original published plugin here](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/kudos-plugin)

Sorry if I'm infringing on any copyrights, but I have done my due diligence in trying to contact the original author.
